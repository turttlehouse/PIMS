## Requirements and Installation Instructions

### 1. Python Installation:

#### For Windows:

1. Download the latest Python installer for Windows from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. During installation, ensure to check "Add Python to PATH".
3. Verify the installation by opening a Command Prompt and running:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

#### For macOS:

1. Check if Python is installed by running:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

    If not, install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

1. Open a terminal and run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3
    ```

2. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

### 2. Checking Python in PATH:

Ensure Python is added to the system PATH. Open a new terminal/command prompt window and run:

```bash
python --version
```

If it returns the Python version, you're set. If not, update your system PATH.

### 3. SQLite Installation:

SQLite comes bundled with Python; no separate installation is usually needed.

### 4. SQLiteStudio:

Use [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) as a GUI tool for managing SQLite databases. Download and install it according to your operating system.

---

With these tools installed and Python in your system PATH, proceed with setting up the Patient Information Management System as described in the previous README section.

Note: Ensure administrative privileges for installing Python and modifying the system PATH.

## Setting Up and Running the Local Server:

1. Set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. Set the execution policy for the current PowerShell session to RemoteSigned:

    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies, apply migrations, and run the local server:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Superuser Access to Django Database:

To create a superuser and access the Django admin site:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Note**:This project uses Python with the Django Web Framework, SQLite as the database, and is developed as a web application.
